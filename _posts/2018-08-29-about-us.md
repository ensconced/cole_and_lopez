Design and fabrication for creative industries.

We are a company that makes original and unique objects for film, TV and theatre productions, as well as fine artists and designers. All with passion and to a high technical standard.

Formed by Daniel Cole and Miguel Lopez. Together we have a diverse skill base and knowledge of creative techniques and processes that we bring to our work, and over the many years that we have worked in the film industry we have built up a close network of skilled and passionate colleagues and collaborators who work over a variety of disciplines. This gives us the scope to take on and successfully execute all manner of projects involving design, sculpting, modelmaking, electronics, graphics, special effects, mouldmaking, casting and fabrication in a wide range of materials.
