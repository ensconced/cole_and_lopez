# Todo

- [ ] use https://github.com/dazuaz/responsive-loader or similar to improve image loading performance
- [ ] make separate branch with instagram stuff - use proper instagram basic display api to get thumbnails etc and display nicely with react?
- [ ] hook up the CMS
- [ ] add prepush yarn build?
- [ ] do we need to reinstate the code which hides the nav while form fields are focussed?
