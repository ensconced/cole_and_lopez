# Todo

- [ ] issue with cms login redirects?
- [ ] make separate branch with instagram stuff - use proper instagram basic display api to get thumbnails etc and display nicely with react?
- [ ] reinstate fullscreen button
- [ ] prevent build from breaking when there are no gallery images - change directory used for require.context to one which always exists, even if all images removed, and only take partial contents of that (the directory registered for the collection in config.yml...)
- [ ] how does ordering of the collections work in netlify CMS?
- [ ] do we need to reinstate the code which hides the nav while form fields are focussed?
- [ ] check image urls in meta tags in index.html still exist
