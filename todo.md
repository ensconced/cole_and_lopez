# Todo

- [ ] decide height of iframe based on gallery image sizes - to avoid big gap at top...- use react shadow dom?
- [ ] reinstate fullscreen button
- [ ] extract separate package for gallery?
- [ ] add prepush yarn build?
- [ ] hook up the CMS
- [ ] switch to sharp package for faster image processing
- [ ] get netlify to do yarn build
- [ ] make separate branch with instagram stuff - use proper instagram basic display api to get thumbnails etc and display nicely with react?
- [ ] do we need to reinstate the code which hides the nav while form fields are focussed?
